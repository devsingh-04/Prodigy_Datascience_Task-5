Traffic Accident Analysis

Overview

This repository contains the code and data for analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The project aims to provide insights into factors contributing to accidents and visualize accident hotspots for informed decision-making in transportation safety.

Features

Data Analysis:
Utilizes Python libraries such as pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.

Visualization: 
Generates interactive visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to explore accident trends and contributing factors.

Descriptive Statistics:
Provides summary statistics and explores correlations between variables to uncover insights.

Machine Learning: 
Implements predictive modeling techniques to forecast accident occurrences based on historical data.

Geospatial Analysis:
Utilizes geospatial libraries like GeoPandas and Folium to visualize accident locations on maps.

Dataset

The dataset used for analysis includes information on:

Date and time of accidents

Weather conditions at the time of the accident

Road conditions

Accident location

Number of injuries and fatalities

Usage

Data Loading:
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Data Cleaning:
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Explore the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify patterns and correlations.

Feature Engineering:
Engineer new features and transform existing ones to improve model performance

Model Building: 
Build machine learning models to predict accident occurrences or severity.

Visualization: 
Visualize accident hotspots, contributing factors, and predictive model results.
